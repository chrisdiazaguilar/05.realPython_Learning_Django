Hi there! 👋

I'm currently learning **Django**, a powerful Python web framework that makes it easier to build complex and feature-rich web applications. This journey is all about diving into Django by building a real-world project step by step. 💻✨

## 🚀 What I'm Learning

Through this hands-on learning experience, I'm building a fully functional web application and picking up essential Django skills along the way. Here’s what I’m focusing on:

✅ What Django is and why it’s such a great framework for web development  
✅ How Django’s architecture works and how it compares to other frameworks  
✅ How to set up a new Django 2 project and create apps  
✅ Building a **personal portfolio website** using Django 2 and Python 3
